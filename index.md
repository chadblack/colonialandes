## Welcome

Welcome to History 561: Readings in Colonial Andean History. During the course of this semester, we will read a large number of books, both classic and recent, in order to gain a firm grounding in the historiography of the colonial Andes. During this course, we will consider the Andean region to encompass largely the territory occupied by the Inka Empire on the eve of the conquest, stretching from the south of modern-day Colombia to the north of modern-day Chile. But, we won't be restricting ourselves to the mountains. Andean society, with its archipelago of microclimates and production zones, spanned the region from the eastern foothills in Amazonia to the Pacific coast. And so shall we.  

The course website is divided into three different sections:
