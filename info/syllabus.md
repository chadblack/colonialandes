# about  
**History 561: Readings in the Colonial Andes**  

This readings seminar will expose students to the historiography of the colonial Andean region, with works both old and new. We will focus on major issues, theoretical debates, and themes that have shaped the field. The course will particularly focus on relationships of culture, power, and authority in the post-conquest Andes, with an eye to how race, gender, and ethnicity manifested these relationships. Thus, we will consider conquest, religion, slavery, family, communication and revolt in the Andean world from 1530-1800.

**Course Objectives:**  

1.  Students will build familiarity with the broader historiographic development of research on the colonial Andean region. 

2. Students will be able to identify the source base, theoretical emphases, and empirical methods that cluster across the periods of historiography in the colonial Andes.  

3. Students will hone their ability to analyze, synthesize, and communicate in written and oral forms these historiographic trends.  

Reading, writing, and oral assignments for this course are designed to meet these three goals. In meeting them, you will also be able to place Spanish imperial rule in from the 16th-19th centuries in a comparative context with other periods of imperial expansion.
