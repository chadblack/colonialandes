## Assignments and Grading

This semester, I have decided to dispense with my normal large historiography project, traditionally constituted of a review of 15-20 additional works to the reading list. Instead, we will spread the reading and writing out through the course of the semester. 

Student's overall grade will be based on a combination of review papers and participation/leading discussion.  

1. *Review Essays* (70% of grade). Students must write seven review essays during the course of the semester, drawn from weeks in which two books are assigned (Weeks 3, 4, 6-9, 11-15). Essays should target 1200-1400 words, and should briefly summarize and analyze the two books under consideration. Particular attention should be paid to the evidential base of the books, how they relate to one another, and the historiographic role they play in the field of colonial Andean history. What are the most and least persuasive elements of the argument? How persuasive is the general argument? How does this reading change the way we think about larger theme chosen for each week. Where do they stand in relation to the schema of source-based historiographic development laid out by Lockhart? Etc. 

Please be concise, yet erudite. If you need guidance, you might speak to students who took Dr. Harlow's seminar last semester, read some essays in *Reviews in American History* or imagine shorter versions of what is done in *History Compass*. Pay attention to your writing. Consult Joseph Williams' *Style: Toward Clarity and Grace* (you can dispense with Strunk and White, already!). 

Review essays are due at the start of class on the weeks you choose to write them. 

2. *Leading Class Discussion* (30% of grade). Each student will pick a week to lead discussion. For each week, even those in which no student is assigned, everyone must email the collective with a short discurtation for the discussion of the books -- questions, observations, etc. Questions/observations must be submitted no later than 5pm on Monday. 

And that is it.
