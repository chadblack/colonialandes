# resources to read better

A quick note on reading for this class... We have a lot of reading assigned for this course, more than some of you may be accustomed to. Reading well as a graduate student is an art, and a learned behavior. It's not something that you intuit simply by being literate. Here are a few resources to help you strategize your reading for this semester (and, for that matter, in preparing for comps).  

*  W. Caleb McDaniel, [How to Read for History](http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/howtoread.html)
*  Paul Edwards, [How to Read a Book](http://pne.people.si.umich.edu/PDF/howtoread.pdf) (pdf) 
*  From William Cronon's [Learning to Do Historical Research](http://www.williamcronon.net/researching/index.htm), Cathy DeShano and Emma Schroeder's [The Pleasures of Note-Taking](http://www.williamcronon.net/researching/notetaking.htm)
